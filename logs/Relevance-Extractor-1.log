## The reception of the GenAI chat

Within just a few days of DeepSeekâ€™s launch, users who tested it pointed out several visible benefits:

People noticed lower costs of model fine-tuning compared to GPT. The API pricing for a million input tokens is $[1;36m0.14[0m for DeepSeek and $[1;36m2.50[0m for ChatGPT-4o.
-
Advanced capabilities [1m([0mMulti-Head Latent Attention[1m)[0m for generating content, coding, and solving problems.
-
Open-source nature allows companies to fine-tune models, which is a great asset for many industries that need the processing of complex technical tasks.
-
Users also noticed some problems with privacy and censorship that were widely commented on across the web.

However, DeepSeek has done something many expected from American tech giantsâ€”made their AI model freely available for worldwide use, especially taking into consideration the announcement of publishing
[1;36m5[0m code repositories for full transparency. While OpenAI allows only some of the models to be fine-tuned through their API, DeepSeek-R1 is completely open-source, giving users full access to adapt it 
as needed.
