More broadly, capital allocation across a range of corporate finance activities can be improved by insights into the size and materiality of risks, while payments and transfers can be protected 
through better encryption.

 This appears to be a sensible strategy as long as quantum computers remain subcritical for practical applications and there is no dominant design for scaling quantum capabilities.

Many financial industry participants rely on computing power to improve decision making and serve customers better. [33m...[0m Over the next few years, quantum computing is likely to supercharge these 
activities. 

 Still, quantum computing increasingly appears to be a game changer in tackling complex or intractable problems, particularly in the optimization area. [33m...[0m It is only a matter of time before quantum 
solutions enter the mainstream, which means the window for getting up to speed and gaining competitive advantage will not be open for long.

What gives quantum computing this enormous advantage? [33m...[0m The solution space of a quantum computer is orders of magnitude larger than traditional computersâ€”even immensely powerful ones. [33m...[0m Thatâ€™s 
because doubling the power of a classical computer requires about double the number of transistors working on a problem. [33m...[0m The power of a quantum computer can be approximately doubled each time only
one qubit is added.

 Quantum computingâ€™s specific use cases for financial services can be classified into three main categories: targeting and prediction, trading optimization, and risk profiling. [33m...[0m Because 
combinatorial optimization problems in trading and portfolio management scale exponentially, quantum computers have the potential to find faster, more cost-effective and better-tailored solutions than
classical machines. [33m...[0m Because combinatorial optimization problems in trading and portfolio management scale exponentially, quantum computers have the potential to find faster, more cost-effective 
and better-tailored solutions than classical machines. [33m...[0m Risk analysis calculations are hard because it is computationally challenging to analyze numerous scenarios. [33m...[0m Quantum computers have the 
potential to sample data differently, providing a quadratic speed-up for these types of simulations.
