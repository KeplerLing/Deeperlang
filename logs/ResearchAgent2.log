As a distributed ledger protocol composed of encrypted blocks of data organized in chains, blockchain represents a potential tool to solve the shortcomings of EHRs in terms of interoperability and 
privacy. [33m...[0m In this paper, we define EHRs and blockchain technology and introduce several classic schemes based on blockchain technology to strengthen EHR interoperability and privacy protection. [33m...[0m
We then review ongoing challenges in the areas of data management efficiency, fairness of access, and trust in the systems. [33m...[0m In this commentary, we suggest ongoing research needs for health 
informatics, data sciences, and ethics to establish EHRs based on blockchain technology. [33m...[0m Blockchain-based EHR schemes must address the potential inequality of healthcare resources, the huge carbon
footprint of computational needs, and potential distrust of health providers and patients that may ensue with wider use of blockchain technology.

To accomplish our goals, we adopt blockchain technology, especially the permissioned consortium type [1m[[0m[1;36m9[0m[1m][0m, using the Hyperledger Fabric [1m([0mHLF[1m)[0m platform. [33m...[0m Multiple hospitals gather to form a 
consortium having a private peer-to-peer network, and permission to join it is determined based on consensus among the members.

 HLF is an open-source platform that has many essential components available in some programming languages. [33m...[0m In addition, it provides the Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol [1m[[0m[1;36m10[0m[1m][0m for 
ordering transactions to a block. [33m...[0m Moreover, it allows end-to-end [1m[[0m[1;36m11[0m[1m][0m throughput of more than [1;36m3[0m,[1;36m500[0m transactions per second. [33m...[0m It is a project [1m[[0m[1;36m12[0m[1m][0m hosted by the Linux Foundation, and 
contributions to the project are made by Digital Asset and IBM.
