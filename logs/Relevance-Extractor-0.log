# Title:Large language models can help boost food production, but be mindful of their risks

View PDF HTML [1m([0mexperimental[1m)[0mAbstract:Coverage of ChatGPT-style large language models [1m([0mLLMs[1m)[0m in the media has focused on their eye-catching achievements, including solving advanced mathematical 
problems and reaching expert proficiency in medical examinations. But the gradual adoption of LLMs in agriculture, an industry which touches every human life, has received much less public scrutiny. 
In this short perspective, we examine risks and opportunities related to more widespread adoption of language models in food production systems. While LLMs can potentially enhance agricultural 
efficiency, drive innovation, and inform better policies, challenges like agricultural misinformation, collection of vast amounts of farmer data, and threats to agricultural jobs are important 
concerns. The rapid evolution of the LLM landscape underscores the need for agricultural policymakers to think carefully about frameworks and guidelines that ensure the responsible use of LLMs in food
production before these technologies become so ingrained that policy intervention becomes challenging.
