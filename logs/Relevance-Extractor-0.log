## Introduction
DeepSeek has emerged as a cost-effective alternative in the landscape of large language models [1m([0mLLMs[1m)[0m. This report explores the reasons behind its affordability by examining the primary cost 
components, comparing its pricing with competitors, and identifying specific technologies or business strategies that contribute to its low costs.

## Primary Cost Components
DeepSeek's cost structure is notably efficient, with the training of its latest R1 model costing approximately **$[1;36m5.58[0m million**. This is significantly lower than the hundreds of millions or even 
billions spent by major American tech companies on similar models. The cost efficiency is reflected in the pricing of DeepSeek's services, which are substantially lower than those of its competitors. 
For instance, the input and output costs for DeepSeek's models are a fraction of what OpenAI charges for its GPT-4o model. [1m[[0mSource[1m][0m[1m([0m[4;94mhttps://explodingtopics.com/blog/deepseek-ai[0m[4;94m)[0m

## Pricing Comparison
DeepSeek's pricing strategy is highly competitive. While DeepSeek offers free usage options, API access incurs costs. However, these costs are minimal compared to those of similar services. For 
example, DeepSeek's input price for its chat model is $[1;36m0.07[0m per million tokens [1m([0mcache hit[1m)[0m, whereas OpenAI's GPT-4o charges $[1;36m1.25[0m for the same service. This stark difference highlights DeepSeek's 
affordability across various usage scenarios. [1m[[0mSource[1m][0m[1m([0m[4;94mhttps://explodingtopics.com/blog/deepseek-ai[0m[4;94m)[0m

## Technologies and Business Strategies
DeepSeek employs several strategies to maintain low costs. The company focuses on developing open-source LLMs, allowing for iterative improvements and variations without the high costs associated with
proprietary technologies. Additionally, DeepSeek offers multiple services, including a web interface, mobile application, and API access, which are designed to be cost-effective and accessible.
